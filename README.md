# Munin LiteSpeed Plugins for cPanel

A collection of robust Munin plugins designed to monitor LiteSpeed Web Server. These scripts have been specifically tested and adapted for cPanel environments and are written in modern, strict Perl for reliability.

Inspired by various community plugins and completely rewritten for robustness and cPanel compatibility.

cd /root
git clone [https://github.com/kaellego/munin-litespeed-cpanel.git] munin-litespeed-cpanel

# 2. Move the plugin files to the cPanel munin directory
sudo mv munin-litespeed-cpanel/litespeed_* /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/share/munin/plugins/

# 3. Make the plugins executable
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/share/munin/plugins/litespeed_*

# 4. Create the symbolic links to activate the plugins
